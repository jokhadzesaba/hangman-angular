        <strong>Objective:</strong> Your goal is to guess the hidden word by
        suggesting letters or guessing the entire word. You start with 5 lives,
        and each incorrect guess results in the loss of a life.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Getting Started:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The game will provide you with a hint for the word you need to
            guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can choose to enter individual characters one by one or guess
            the entire word at once.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Guessing a Letter:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Enter a single letter and press submit to check if it's part of the
            hidden word.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in its corresponding
            positions in the word.
          </li>
          <li>If the letter is incorrect, you lose a life.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Guessing the Entire Word:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you think you know the entire word, you can enter the complete
            word and submit your guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your guess is correct, you not only reveal the entire word but
            also gain an additional life.
          </li>
          <li>If your guess is incorrect, you lose a life.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Scoring and Leaderboard:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your score is based on the number of words you successfully guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            After losing all 5 lives, your final score will be displayed on the
            leaderboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            The leaderboard keeps track of the number of words guessed, and you
            can aim to improve your score with each attempt.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Additional Lives:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Successfully guessing the entire word earns you one additional life.
          </li>
          <li>You can accumulate extra lives to extend your gameplay.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Game Continuation:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can continue playing as long as you want, attempting to guess
            more words and increase your score.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
